First, the RecyclerView asks how
many objects are in the list by calling the
adapter’s getItemCount() method.
Then the RecyclerView calls the
adapter’s
onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup
int) method to create a new
ViewHolder, along with its juicy
payload: a View to display.
Finally, the RecyclerView calls
onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder,
int). The RecyclerView will pass
a ViewHolder into this method along
with the position. The adapter will look
up the model data for that position and
bind it to the ViewHolder’s View. To
bind it, the adapter fills in the View to
reflect the data in the model object.
After this process is complete,
RecyclerView will place a list item
on the screen. Note that
onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup
int) will happen a lot less often than
onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder,
int). Once enough ViewHolders
have been created, RecyclerView
stops calling
onCreateViewHolder(...). Instead,
it saves time and memory by recycling
old ViewHolders.
